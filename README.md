# README for makefiles

### Each folder contains the files used to compile ROMS for one of our machines, e.g. mox and klone.

---

#### lo8k
This is the first one for compiling on klone.  It is similar to lo8 (mox) in that it is for LO_ROMS but with the bio flags turned off. It also is the first use of NetCDF4 in ROMS.

#### lo8kb
Like lo8k but with the bio flags turned on.
